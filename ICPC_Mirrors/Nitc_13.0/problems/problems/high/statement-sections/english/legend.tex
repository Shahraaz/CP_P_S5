Henry profiles a high load database migration script. The script is the list of $n$ transactions. The $i$-th transaction consists of $a_i$ queries. Henry wants to split the script to the minimum possible number of batches, where each batch contains either one transaction or a sequence of consecutive transactions, and the total number of queries in each batch does not exceed $t$.

Unfortunately, Henry does not know the exact value of $t$ for the production database, so he is going to estimate the minimum number of batches for $q$ possible values of $t$: $t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_q$. Help Henry to calculate the number of transactions for each of them.
