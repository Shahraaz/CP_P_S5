The first line of the input contains two integers $w$ and $h$~--- the width and the height of the patch of fabric ($1 \le w, h \le 100$).

The following $h$ lines contain the face of the pattern. Each of them contains $w$ characters, where `\texttt{X}' represents a cross, and `\texttt{.}'~--- an empty space. The face of the pattern contains at least one cross and crosses are 8-connected.
