The first line of output should contain the single integer $n$~--- the number of stitches required to embroider the pattern. 

The following $n + 1$ lines should contain the coordinates of the points where a needle comes from the backside to the face or back: $x_i$, $y_i$ for $i=0..n$. The upper-left corner of the patch has coordinates $(0, 0)$, and the bottom-right one~--- $(w, h)$. The first stitch goes to the face of the pattern, the second one~--- to the backside, the third one~--- to the face, and so on. It is possible to duplicate stitches at the backside, but not at the face. None of the stitches should have zero length.
