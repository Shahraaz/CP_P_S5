A \textit{palindrome} is a string that reads the same backward as forward. For example, \texttt{rotator}, \texttt{lil} and \texttt{abba} are palindromes, but \texttt{shalash} is not.

A \textit{double palindrome} is a string that is either a palindrome or a concatenation of two (not necessarily distinct) palindromes. For example, \texttt{susanna}, \texttt{potato} and \texttt{abba} are double palindromes, but \texttt{zzyzx} and \texttt{abaabb} are not.

Dalila has just realized that her name is a double palindrome! Now she wonders how many non-empty strings of length at most $n$ composed of the first $k$ English letters have the same property. Help her find this number and output it modulo $998\,244\,353$.
