\begin{problem}{Double Palindrome}{standard input}{standard output}{2 seconds}{512 megabytes}

A \textit{palindrome} is a string that reads the same backward as forward. For example, \texttt{rotator}, \texttt{lil} and \texttt{abba} are palindromes, but \texttt{shalash} is not.

A \textit{double palindrome} is a string that is either a palindrome or a concatenation of two (not necessarily distinct) palindromes. For example, \texttt{susanna}, \texttt{potato} and \texttt{abba} are double palindromes, but \texttt{zzyzx} and \texttt{abaabb} are not.

Dalila has just realized that her name is a double palindrome! Now she wonders how many non-empty strings of length at most $n$ composed of the first $k$ English letters have the same property. Help her find this number and output it modulo $998\,244\,353$.


\InputFile
The only line contains two integers $n$ and $k$~--- the maximum length of the string and the size of the alphabet ($1 \le n \le 10^5$; $1 \le k \le 26$).

\OutputFile
Output the number of non-empty double palindromes of length at most $n$ composed of the first $k$ English letters, modulo $998\,244\,353$.

\Examples

\begin{example}
\exmpfile{example.01}{example.01.a}%
\exmpfile{example.02}{example.02.a}%
\exmpfile{example.03}{example.03.a}%
\end{example}

\Note
In the first example the strings to be counted are: \texttt{a}, \texttt{b}, \texttt{c}, \texttt{aa}, \texttt{ab}, \texttt{ac}, \texttt{ba}, \texttt{bb}, \texttt{bc}, \texttt{ca}, \texttt{cb}, \texttt{cc}, \texttt{aaa}, \texttt{aab}, \texttt{aac}, \texttt{aba}, \texttt{abb}, \texttt{aca}, \texttt{acc}, \texttt{baa}, \texttt{bab}, \texttt{bba}, \texttt{bbb}, \texttt{bbc}, \texttt{bcb}, \texttt{bcc}, \texttt{caa}, \texttt{cac}, \texttt{cbb}, \texttt{cbc}, \texttt{cca}, \texttt{ccb}, \texttt{ccc}.
