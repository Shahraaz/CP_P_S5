Every day a new programming problem is published on Codehorses. Thus, $n$ problems will be published in the following $n$ days: the difficulty of the $i$-th problem is $a_i$.

Polycarp wants to choose exactly three days $i$, $j$ and $k$ ($i < j < k$) so that the difference of difficulties on the day $j$ and the day $i$ is equal to the difference of difficulties on the day $k$ and day $j$.
In other words, Polycarp wants equality $a_j-a_i=a_k-a_j$ to be true.

Determine the number of possible ways for Polycarp to choose the three days in the desired way.
