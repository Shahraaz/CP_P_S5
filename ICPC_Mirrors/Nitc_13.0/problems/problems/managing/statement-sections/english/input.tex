The first line contains an integer $t$~--- the number of test cases in the input ($1 \le t \le 10$). Then $t$ test case descriptions follow.

The first line of a test case contains an integer $n$~--- the number of the days ($3 \le n \le 2000$).

The second line of the test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$, where $a_i$ is the difficulty of the problem on the $i$-th day ($1 \le a_i \le 10^9$).
