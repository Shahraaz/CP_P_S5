\begin{problem}{Managing Difficulties}{standard input}{standard output}{2 seconds}{512 megabytes}

Every day a new programming problem is published on Codehorses. Thus, $n$ problems will be published in the following $n$ days: the difficulty of the $i$-th problem is $a_i$.

Polycarp wants to choose exactly three days $i$, $j$ and $k$ ($i < j < k$) so that the difference of difficulties on the day $j$ and the day $i$ is equal to the difference of difficulties on the day $k$ and day $j$.
In other words, Polycarp wants equality $a_j-a_i=a_k-a_j$ to be true.

Determine the number of possible ways for Polycarp to choose the three days in the desired way.

\InputFile
The first line contains an integer $t$~--- the number of test cases in the input ($1 \le t \le 10$). Then $t$ test case descriptions follow.

The first line of a test case contains an integer $n$~--- the number of the days ($3 \le n \le 2000$).

The second line of the test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$, where $a_i$ is the difficulty of the problem on the $i$-th day ($1 \le a_i \le 10^9$).


\OutputFile
Output $t$ integers~--- the answers for each of the test cases in the input, in the order they are given. The answer to a test case is the number of triples of indices $i$, $j$, and $k$ such that $1 \le i < j < k \le n$ and $a_k-a_j=a_j-a_i$.
