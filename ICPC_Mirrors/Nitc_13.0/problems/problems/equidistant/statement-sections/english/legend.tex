In 2019 ICPC subregions structure was changed a little. Now for each subregion, we need to choose the best place for the subregion finals. To make things fair we want to choose a city in such a way that all teams will spend the same amount of time to get there.

To make things simpler we say that all teams will use trains to get to the finals. The railroad system can be represented as a tree where each city is a vertex and some pairs of cities are connected by a railroad. It takes exactly one hour to get from one city to another if they are directly connected. 

You are given a description of the railroad system and the cities where teams are located. You need to choose any city that has an equal distance to all teams' cities or detect that no such city exists.
