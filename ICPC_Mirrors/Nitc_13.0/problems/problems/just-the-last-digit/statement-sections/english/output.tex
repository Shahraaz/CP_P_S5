Print $n$ lines, describing the map of the hill in the similar format: the $i$-th line should contain $n$ characters, where $j$-th character is \t{1} if there is a trail from the $i$-th spot to the $j$-th spot, and \t{0} otherwise. For every $i \ge j$, the $j$-th character in the $i$-th row must be \t{0}.
