The first line of the input contains an integer $n$~--- the number of spots on the hill  ($2 \le n \le 500$).
Next, $n$ lines follow: the $i$-th line contains $n$ characters $a_{i,1}, a_{i,2}, \ldots, a_{i,n}$. Character $a_{i, j}$ is the last digit of the number of different jogs made by Jessie starting at the $i$-th spot and ending at the $j$-th spot. For every $i \ge j$, $a_{i, j} = 0$.

It is guaranteed that a solution always exists for the given input data.
