The King of Byteland has decided to divide the country into provinces, one for each of his children.

The map of Byteland is a rectangular matrix consisting of $n$ rows and $m$ columns. Each king's child has a castle, located in one of the cells of the matrix (each cell contains at most one castle). King wants to split the Byteland in the following way:
\begin{itemize}
\item Each province must be a rectangle.
\item Each cell of the Byteland territory must belong to exactly one province.
\item Each province must contain the castle of exactly one king's child, the owner of this province.
\end{itemize}

The king loves all his children, but one of them is his favorite. The king wants to split the kingdom in such a way that the area of the province that belongs to his favorite child is as large as possible. Can you help him to solve this tricky task?
