Galina is an aspiring golfer and spends all her free time at a minigolf park. Her favorite golf course in this park is a rectangle, with one of its sides parallel to the north-south direction, and the other one parallel to the east-west direction. The ball is really small and can be considered a point.

Galina wants to practice a specific shot called ``put''. In this shot, a ball is placed somewhere inside the golf course and hit north-east, obtaining the speed of $\sqrt{2}$ inches per second. This means that the ball starts moving by exactly $1$ inch to the north and $1$ inch to the east per second. 

The golf park uses an innovative technology that eliminates all friction, and the ball will continue to move at the initial speed regardless of the traveled distance. Collisions with golf course borders will be perfectly elastic. Fancy!

Inside the course there is a pond that is represented as a simple polygon with edges parallel to the sides of the golf course. If the ball touches the pond, it sinks momentarily.

You are given a list of starting coordinates for Galina's next put training session. For each starting position, assuming a put is shot from this place, calculate how long the ball will travel before falling into the pond and find exactly where it happens, or determine that the ball will move indefinitely.
